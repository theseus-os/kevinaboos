							<h2>Research Interests</h2>
							I am a systems researcher interested in mobile operating systems, state management and synchronization, and virtualization. I'm currently researching a way to eliminate <em>state entanglement</em>, i.e., decoupling mobile applications from the underlying OS Service and other components on which they run. Synchronizing the states of applications and OS data structures in the <em>mobile domain</em> presents new challenges, namely low latency and energy efficiency requirements. 
							<br> <br>
							In the past I have worked on virtual reality, I/O virtualization, multiscreen streaming frameworks, static analysis of device drivers, software engineering tools for change impact analysis, and novel debugging procedures for mobile robotics.

							I'm currently a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a> working with <a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lzhong/">Dr. Lin Zhong</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~mobile/">Rice Efficient Computing Group (RECG)</a>. I first joined RECG in the summer of 2012, and so far I'm heartily enjoying my graduate experience here.

							In 2011, I graduated from <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a> with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, where I focused on embedded systems and software. 
							<br> After graduating from UT Austin, I continued as a graduate student in UT Austin's Software Engineering department for one year until I transferred to Rice.

							<h2>About me</h2>
							I was born and raised in north Dallas, TX, where I attended Lake Highlands High School. My father worked as a patent lawyer and my mother was an insurance agent and homemaker during my childhood. I have one younger brother who is currently a student at the renowned <a href="http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/">McCombs School of Business</a> at UT Austin. 
							<br class="clearfix" /> 
							<br class="clearfix" /> 
							In my spare time, I enjoy cooking all kinds of cuisines, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, new American, and Italian. I have always been a musical person; I started playing classical piano at the age of 6 and haven't stopped since. I also played jazz saxophone all throughout high school (and once in college) and, as a result, I'm a huge fan of jazz and big band swing. I enjoy things related to Chinese and Vietnamese culture, and can speak some Chinese (don't test me...) after spending a <a href="http://www.chinatefl.com/beijing/study/bjie.html">summer in Beijing</a>.

							As of 2012, my wife and I live in Sugar Land with our dog Puma. We met when we were students at UT Austin together, and were married in 2013. She currently works as a hardware developer for IBM in Houston.
